**Phosphate:** This indicator provides information about the
concentration of phosphate in the region. Phosphorus is a limiting
nutrient for aquatic organisms and enters the ocean from the land rather
than the atmosphere. Phosphates come from fertilizers and sewage
entering the ocean as run off causing pollution and eutrophication.
