**Nitratephosphate ratio:** This provides an indication of the ratio of
nitrate to phosphate in the region. Nutrients play an important role in
the health of marine ecosystems controlling the abundance of many
species of phytoplankton or algae. If the ratio of nutrients goes off
balance it can create an unhealthy system, often characterised by
harmful algal blooms.
