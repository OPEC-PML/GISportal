**Silicate:** this indicator provides a measure silicate in the region.
Nutrients play an important role in the health of marine ecosystems
controlling the abundance of many species of phytoplankton. Silicate has
a particular role in the regulation of diatoms which use it to construct
their cell walls. Diatoms can contribute significantly to primary
production and their biomass is affected by the availability and
distribution of silicate.
