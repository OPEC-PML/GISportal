**Seabirds:** This is a modelled indication of the biomass of seabirds
in the system. Seabirds are useful environmental indicators as they
represent the top of the food chain and changes in their populations can
indicate changes at lower trophic levels or in the physic-chemical
environment. They are also easily affected by human activities such as
over exploitation of their food source ie fishing and marine pollution.
