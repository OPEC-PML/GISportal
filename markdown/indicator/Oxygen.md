**Oxygen:** This indicator provides a measure of dissolved oxygen in the water. The ocean is an important source of oxygen with around three-fourths of the earth's oxygen supply produced as a waste product by phytoplankton. Oxygen levels can be impacted by changes in ocean temperature and salinity affecting its solubility and is removed from the system by biological activity through respiration. In highly nutrient rich systems this latter process can lead to hypoxia.
