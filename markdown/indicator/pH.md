**pH:** is a measure of the acidity of the ocean.  As the ocean absorbs an increasing amount of carbon dioxide the overall pH of the marine environment is decreasing (becoming more acidic). Many marine organisms are sensitive to changes in pH, with increasing acidity causing stress on animal physiology and reproductive success. This may lead to significant changes in the communities of marine organisms.
