**pCO2:** This indicator is a measure of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO~2~)in the ocean's surface waters. pCO~2~ provides information on the cycling of dissolved carbon and associated chemicals (oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus). PCO~2~ varies with alkalinity, latitude, depths and temperature and is also affected by biological processes in the ocean.
