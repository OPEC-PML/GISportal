**Nitrate/silicate ratio:** This provides an indication of the ratio of nitrate to silicate in the region. Nutrients play an important role in the health of marine ecosystems controlling the abundance of many species of phytoplankton or algae. If the ratio of nutrients goes off balance it can create an unhealthy system by producing either too much or too little algae.
