**Regional Summary: Baltic Sea**

The Baltic is a semi-enclosed, brackish water sea. The salinity varies from the average salinity in the North Sea to 2-3 PSU in the northern Bothnian Bay. In OPEC, higher trophic level modelling concentrates on fish species supporting most of the fisheries in the Baltic Sea, namely cod, herring and sprat even though the Baltic ecosystem biodiversity is much richer from a species perspective.
