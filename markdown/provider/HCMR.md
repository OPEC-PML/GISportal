HMCR is a highly active centre for marine research, created in 2003 from the merger of the National Centre for Marine Research with the Institute of Marine Biology of Crete.

**Regional Summary: Mediterranean Sea**

The Mediterranean Sea is a semi-enclosed sea, characterised by an inverse estuarine circulation with the Atlantic Ocean. Morphologically, it can be divided in two sub-regions (the Strait of Sicily separates the western and eastern Mediterranean), and it is characterized by the presence of a narrow continental shelf and two marginal sub-regions (the Adriatic Sea and the Aegean Sea). The major inflow into the Mediterranean is nutrient-poor, oxygenated Atlantic surface water through the Strait of Gibraltar. The western sub-basin is seasonally stratified and large parts of the open ocean eastern sub-basin are permanently stratified.
