Higher trophic level modelling in the NE Atlantic was carried out by *Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science* (Cefas), an Executive Agency of the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)

**Regional Summary: North East Atlantic**

The applied North East Atlantic region spans the area from 40&deg; to 65&deg; North in latitudinal direction (approximately Lisbon to Iceland) and from 20&deg; West to 13&deg; East in longitudinal direction (Iceland to the Belt). This vast area spans across the entire North West European shelf and ranges from estuarine and coastal waters over typical shelf seas (like the North Sea or the Celtic Sea) to parts of the deep North Atlantic Ocean basin. The region can largely be described as a seasonally stratified, down welling shelf sea system with a net inflow of surface waters and a net outflow on the sea floor across the shelf break into the deep Atlantic with a generally anti-clockwise circulation
of the North-Sea.
