Black Sea models have been developed by the [Institute of Marine Science](http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr)at the Middle East Technical University (METU)

**Regional Summary: North East Atlantic**

The Black Sea is one of the major semi-enclosed seas of the world oceans and has experienced striking ecological changes due to impacts of climate change, intense eutrophication, population explosion of some invasive species and unsustainable fisheries with their density-dependent feedback processes. Nitrate loading increased nearly four-fold during the 1970s due to increased use of agricultural fertilizers.
